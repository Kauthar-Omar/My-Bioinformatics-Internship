To become a leader in bioinformatics having great contribution in genomic research.

`Short term`

To be able to apply my skills learnt during the internship to assigned projects efficiently and with ease making contributions to ongoing research at ICIPE, having keen interest on working with data on microbiome research.

# MISSION

To find my niche in a high demand area/field of bioinformatics and learn the relevant path to take in achieving my goal.
To support and contribute to ongoing projects at ICIPE as a way of finding my niche.

# Goals to achieve my mission
* To equip myself with the relevant set of skills. Here is a [checklist](https://github.com/Kauthar-Omar/My-Bioinformatics-Internship/issues/1) of how am progressing in acquring those skills
* To make myself conversant with the current trends in the genomic research both at ICIPE and Africa at large.
* To build a culture of reading scientific journals and papers. Here is my journal reading [checklist]()
