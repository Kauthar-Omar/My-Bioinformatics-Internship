# My-Bioinformatics-Internship
:wave: 
Hello reader! Welcome to my bioinformatics journey, its a pleasure to have you going through my work.
Get to know me, Kauthar M. Omar, an upcoming bioinformatician and also owner to this repository.
I am a bioinformatics intern at ICIPE figuring out my niche in the bioinformatics space. I am interested in genomic research and its significance in solving problems in health and food security from a computational point of view.

I am an Applied Bioengineering graduate whose keen interest in bioinformatics rose from curiosity an introductory unit to bioinformatics in my undergraduate.
I realized over time that there was a lot more to the field that needed to be learnt to start a career in bioinformatics. 
I am excited to learn new skills, practise them and contribute to ongoing research at ICIPE hence reaping maximum benefits out of internship program
Feel free to visit this repo more than once as they will be various additions at each stage of my 4 month journey.

Below is my vision, mission and roadmap I will follow during this journey.

# VISION

### Long term`

To become a leader in bioinformatics having great contribution in genomic research.

### Short term

To be able to apply my skills learnt during the internship to assigned projects efficiently and with ease making contributions to ongoing research at ICIPE, having keen interest on working with data on microbiome research.

# MISSION

To find my niche in a high demand area/field of bioinformatics and learn the relevant path to take in achieving my goal.
To support and contribute to ongoing projects at ICIPE as a way of finding my niche.

# Goals to achieve my mission
* To equip myself with the relevant set of skills. Here is a [checklist](https://github.com/Kauthar-Omar/My-Bioinformatics-Internship/issues/1) of how am progressing in acquring those skills
* To make myself conversant with the current trends in the genomic research both at ICIPE and Africa at large.
* To build a culture of reading scientific journals and papers. Please find my first [milestone](https://github.com/Kauthar-Omar/My-Bioinformatics-Internship/milestone/1) to keep me on track.
