# Goals

Here are the **goals** I have to achieve my mission:
* To equip myself with the relevant set of skills. Here is a [checklist](https://github.com/Kauthar-Omar/My-Bioinformatics-Internship/issues/6) of how am progressing in acquring those skills
* To make myself conversant with the current trends in the genomic research both at ICIPE and Africa at large.
* To build a culture of reading scientific journals and papers. Please find my first [milestone](https://github.com/Kauthar-Omar/My-Bioinformatics-Internship/milestone/1) to keep me on track.
* To successfully complete a mini project utilising core skils.

**NB** : These goals will form be the foundation to my milestones.


## Roadmap to achieving goals

Before the end of the first month I should have familirized myself with the following skill set:

1. Be well conversant with slack and Github.

I should be able to efficiently coomunicate, interact and retrieve resources posted on Slack.
I should comfortably create repositories, milestones attaching issues to them and create projects.
My project management system should be automized and also utilising cards. 
Formatting of markdowns should be done with ease and attachments such as links, images and emojis should be added successfully.

2. Be well conversant with data capentry.
