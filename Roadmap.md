 Here are the goals I have to achieve my mission:
* To equip myself with the relevant set of skills. Here is a [checklist](https://github.com/Kauthar-Omar/My-Bioinformatics-Internship/issues/6) of how am progressing in acquring those skills
* To make myself conversant with the current trends in the genomic research both at ICIPE and Africa at large.
* To build a culture of reading scientific journals and papers. Please find my first [milestone](https://github.com/Kauthar-Omar/My-Bioinformatics-Internship/milestone/1) to keep me on track.

**NB** : These goals will form be the foundation to my milestones.
