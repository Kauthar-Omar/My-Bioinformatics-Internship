Hello :wave: once more, without further ado lets dive into my roadmap.

# Goals

Here are the **goals** I have to achieve my mission:
* To equip myself with the relevant set of skills. Here is a [checklist](https://github.com/Kauthar-Omar/My-Bioinformatics-Internship/issues/6) of how am progressing in acquring those skills
* To make myself conversant with the current trends in the genomic research both at ICIPE and Africa at large.
* To build a culture of reading scientific journals and papers. Please find my first [milestone](https://github.com/Kauthar-Omar/My-Bioinformatics-Internship/milestone/1) to keep me on track.
* To successfully complete a mini project utilising core skils.

**NB** : These goals will form be the foundation to my milestones.


## Roadmap to achieving goals

Before the end of the first month I should have familirized myself with the following skill set:

1. Be well conversant with slack and Github.

I should be able to efficiently coomunicate, interact and retrieve resources posted on Slack.
I should comfortably create repositories, milestones attaching issues to them and create projects.
My project management system should be automized and also utilising cards. 
Formatting of markdowns should be done with ease and attachments such as links, images and emojis should be added successfully.

2. Be well conversant with data capentry.

I should be able to structure and organize data in a tidy manner before working on it.
I should learn the use of data tidiness tools to validate my data before working on the data
Acquire knowledge on softwares to analyse data.
Know the various file formats data is stored in.
Be able to use public repositories such as European Nucleotide Archives (ENA) and Lenski Sequence Retrivial Archives in data wrangling.

3. Be well conversant with linux

After an introduction to linux, I should practise more on my bash scripts to be well conversant.

4. Build on my Python skills.

I learnt how to use Jupyter notebooks in coding other than my usual platform Pycharm.
I also learnt new fuctions in python and practised both new skills and formally known skills

5. Refresh and build on bioinformatics concepts such as Introduction to Biological Databases, sequence alignment genomics and Phylogenetics

6. Be able to comfortably use the galaxy platform

I should be able to created complete workflows to perfoem an analysis task.
I should also know various tools,their functions and how they are used in generating workflows.
i should be well coversant with different types of input abd utput file formats.
