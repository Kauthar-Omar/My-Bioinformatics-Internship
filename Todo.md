## REPORT ON GALAXY TRAINING NETWORK (GTN) SMORGASBORD COURSE.

### OBJECTIVES.
1. To learn skills to comfortably manuever through the galaxy platform.
2. To be able to create and use workflows for scientific data analysis.
3. To learn about various tools and their implementation in the workflows to achieve a desired results.
4. To learn different data visualization techniques.

### INTRODUCTION.
Galaxy is an open, web-based platform foe accesible, reproducible and transparent computational research.
It includes scientific workflows, data and analysis persistence and publishing platform that aims to make computational biology accesible
to research scientists that do not have computer programming or system administration.
Its data intergration supports data uploads from user's computer by URL, and directly from online resources such as UCSC Genome Browser,
InterMine and BioMart supporting a range of widely used biological data formats and translation between those formats.
Galaxy was originally written for biological data analysis, particularly genomics.
The set of available tools have been expanded over the years to cover gene expression, genome assembly, proteomics, epigenomics, 
transcriptomics and other disciplines in life sciences.
Although it was initially developed for genomic research , it is largely domain agonistic and now is used as a 
a general bioinformatics management workflow.
The GTN Smorgasbord Course was aimed to create awarness and give an introductory training to what the Galaxy platform has to offer.

### HOW TO ACCESS THE COURSE.
In order to undertake the course you need to first create an account in one of the three galaxy servers i.e 
[american/main](UseGalaxy.org), [european](UseGalaxy.eu) or [australian](UseGalaxy.org.au) server.
It is recommended you choose an server near you.
I personally recommend the european instance for Kenyans as it is in good proximity and provides a wider range of tools.
Here is a [link](https://shiltemann.github.io/global-galaxy-course/workshop) to redirect you to the course material.
It includes slides, videos and both written and video tutorials.
